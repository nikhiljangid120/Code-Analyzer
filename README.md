 # Code Analyzer & Algorithm Visualizer    
  
A web-based tool that allows users to analyze code, visualize algorithm execution, and get AI-powered insights. The platform supports multiple programming languages, provides real-time complexity analysis, suggests optimizations, and offers interactive visualizations of data structures and algorithms. 

## Features 

### Code Analyzer
- Input code in multiple languages (JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, C++)
- AI-powered analysis using Gemini API
- Syntax, structure, and complexity analysis
- Optimization suggestions and best practices
- Error detection and debugging recommendations

### Algorithm Visualizer
- Step-by-step execution of sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort)
- Graphical representation of arrays, trees, linked lists, and graphs
- Dynamic step control (play, pause, speed adjust)
- Educational explanations of algorithm behavior and complexity

### Performance Metrics
- Benchmark execution times with different input sizes
- Graphs showing runtime comparisons
- Memory consumption analysis
- Compare multiple algorithms side by side

### User-Friendly UI 
- Modern, responsive design with dark/light mode toggle
- Syntax highlighting code editor
- Interactive visualizations
- Tabbed interface for easy navigation
